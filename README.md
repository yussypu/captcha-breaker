A Python project using OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow to break CAPTCHAs. Grabs CAPTCHA images from a website, preprocesses them into individual characters, trains a neural network to recognize them, and predicts the CAPTCHA solution.

# Features
CAPTCHA Retrieval: Automatically grab CAPTCHA images from a target website.
Image Preprocessing: Split CAPTCHA images into individual character images.
Neural Network Training: Train a neural network to recognize characters.
CAPTCHA Solving: Predict and solve CAPTCHA using the trained model.
